# Ant Colony Optimization
ACO for Travelling Salesman problem

<h3>CONTROLS</h3>

- points is number of points (0 to 1000)
- ants is numeber of ants per round (0 to number of points)
- alpha : is a parameter to control the influence of pheromones (-10 to 10)
- beta : ants liking for a shorter path (-10 to 10)

probability of a path being picked is (pheromones[path])^alpha * (1/distance[path])^beta for a path from x to y

I'd love to receive feedback on the project. :)
