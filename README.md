# Ant Colony Optimization
ACO for Travelling Salesman problem

<h3>CONTROLS</h3>

- points is number of points (0 to 1000)
- ants is number of ants per round (0 to number of points)
- alpha is a parameter to control the influence of pheromones (-10 to 10)
- beta : ants liking for a shorter path (-10 to 10)
- decay is the rate of evaporation of pheromones (0 to 1) (no evaporation to maximum evaporation)

probability of a path being picked is (pheromones[path])<sup>alpha</sup> &times; (1/distance[path])<sup>beta</sup> for a path from x to y

I'd love to receive feedback on the project. :)
